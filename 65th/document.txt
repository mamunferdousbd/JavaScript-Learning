Hoisting
    Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted

        In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
        In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
        x= 10; // Value assign
        console.log(x);
        var x; //variable declared
        ----not possible for let and const-----
